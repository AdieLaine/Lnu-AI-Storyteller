# Story Feature Overview

The `Storyteller` feature of Lnu-AI represents a blend of tradition and technology, aimed at preserving the age-old practice of storytelling in the Mi'kmaq culture while leveraging the state-of-the-art capabilities of AI. By utilizing advanced natural language processing and machine learning, the Storyteller feature creates a platform where users can interact, learn, and connect deeply with the Mi'kmaq language and culture just by entering a single word.
