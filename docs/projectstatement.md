## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Introduction</span>
The Mi'kmaq people, indigenous to the northeastern region of North America, have a rich cultural heritage embodied in a unique language. Like many indigenous languages, the Mi'kmaq language is at risk of extinction. As of our latest data, fewer than 8,500 native speakers remain, underscoring the urgency of preservation efforts. Lnu-AI, an initiative driven by an Mi'kmaq Indigenous AI Researcher, aims to address this issue by harnessing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to preserve and promote the Mi'kmaq language and culture.

## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Objectives</span>
Lnu-AI is motivated by three central objectives:

1. Language Preservation: Develop an AI system capable of accurately interpreting and generating the Mi'kmaq language, contributing to its digital preservation.
2. Education and Promotion: Leverage the AI system to create engaging educational tools and resources to teach and promote Mi'kmaq language and culture.
3. Community Engagement: Foster an inclusive development process by collaborating with the Mi'kmaq community, linguists, AI developers, and those interested in preserving indigenous languages.

## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Methodology</span>
The realization of Lnu-AI involves several stages:

1. Data Collection: Amass a comprehensive dataset of Mi'kmaq language resources, including written texts, audio recordings, and video materials. These will serve as the foundational training data to expand the Embedded Mi'kmaq Corpus using the Lnu-AI system.
2. AI Development: Expand Lnu-AI's Fine-Tuned Models by expanding the Embedded Mi'kmaq Corpus using Large Language Models and Reinforced Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF).
3. Cultural Sensitivity and Accuracy: Work closely with the Mi'kmaq community and linguists to ensure the AI model accurately captures cultural nuances and linguistic details of the Mi'kmaq language.
4. Resource Development: Create versatile educational tools utilizing the AI system, which can range from language learning applications to historical preservation solutions.
5. Evaluation and Dissemination: Evaluate the AI system's effectiveness and its impact on promoting and preserving Mi'kmaq language and culture. Cultivate dialogue and collaboration with other indigenous communities to share the knowledge and experience gained from the project.

## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Applicability</span>
The developed AI system, Lnu-AI, offers broad applications, including:

- Language Learning Aid: Assist learners in grasping Mi'kmaq language nuances through interactive tools and exercises.
- Translation Tool: Facilitate accurate translation between English and Mi'kmaq, aiding in communication and language understanding.
- Linguistic Analysis System: Offer linguistic insights, enhancing the understanding of the Mi'kmaq language structure and evolution.

## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Future Directions</span>
The journey with Lnu-AI doesn't end upon its development. The Lnu-AI Project will continually refine the model's accuracy and broaden its feature set according to community needs and advances in AI technology. By learning from the usage data and feedback, we aim to make the model more versatile and user-friendly. Furthermore, we hope that The Lnu-AI Project setting cultivates initiatives amoung other indigenous nations that aim to preserve their language and culture through AI.

## <span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">Conclusion</span>
Lnu-AI represents a bold approach in leveraging AI to promote and preserve the Mi'kmaq language and culture. The expected outcomes of the project have the potential to make a significant impact on the revitalization of the Mi'kmaq language and the promotion of its rich cultural heritage. With an inclusive, community-driven approach, Lnu-AI strives to contribute significantly to the global effort of indigenous language preservation.
