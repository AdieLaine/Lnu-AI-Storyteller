## <span style="color: white;">Acknowledgements</span>
The Lnu-AI project honors the timeless art of storytelling, keeping the flame of tradition alive and preserving the rhythmic beauty of Mi'kmaq words. Lnu-AI is my heartfelt gift to the Mi'kmaq people, a testament to our shared heritage, and a vital step towards a future where technology and tradition intersect gracefully, celebrating and honoring the richness of cultural diversity.

We would like to acknowledge [Mi'gmaq-Mi'kmaq Online](https://mikmaqonline.org/) for consolidating Listuguj Mi'kmaq translations.

Lnu-AI was born at the crossroads of GPT-4 API and the insatiable curiosity to be creative. We extend out thanks to[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for providing the API solution that was critical in the pre-training and fine-tune process.
